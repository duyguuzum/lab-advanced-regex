Complete the following set of exercises to solidify your knowledge of regular expressions.


import re

1. Use a regular expression to find and extract all vowels in the following text.
text = "This is going to be a sentence with a good number of vowels in it."

pattern = "[aeiou]"
print(re.findall(pattern, text))
['i', 'i', 'o', 'i', 'o', 'e', 'a', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'i', 'a', 'o', 'o', 'u', 'e', 'o', 'o', 'e', 'i', 'i']

2. Use a regular expression to find and extract all occurrences and tenses (singular and plural) of the word "puppy" in the text below.
text = "The puppy saw all the rest of the puppies playing and wanted to join them. I saw this and wanted a puppy of my own!"

pattern = r'\bpupp(?:y|ies)\b'
print(re.findall(pattern, text))
['puppy', 'puppies', 'puppy']

3. Use a regular expression to find and extract all tenses (present and past) of the word "run" in the text below.
text = "I ran the relay race the only way I knew how to run it."

pattern = r'\b(run|ran|running)\b'
print(re.findall(pattern, text))
['ran', 'run']

4. Use a regular expression to find and extract all words that begin with the letter "r" from the previous text.

pattern = r'\b(r\w+)\b'
print(re.findall(pattern, text))
['ran', 'relay', 'race', 'run']

5. Use a regular expression to find and substitute the letter "i" for the exclamation marks in the text below.
text = "Th!s !s a sentence w!th spec!al characters !n !t."

pattern = r'!'
substituted_text = re.sub(pattern, 'i', text)
print(substituted_text)
This is a sentence with special characters in it.

6. Use a regular expression to find and extract words longer than 4 characters in the text below.
text = "This sentence has words of varying lengths."

pattern = r'\b\w{5,}\b'
print(re.findall(pattern, text))
['sentence', 'words', 'varying', 'lengths']

7. Use a regular expression to find and extract all occurrences of the letter "b", some letter(s), and then the letter "t" in the sentence below.
text = "I bet the robot couldn't beat the other bot with a bat, but instead it bit me."

pattern = r'\b[bB]\w+t\b'
print(re.findall(pattern, text))
['bet', 'beat', 'bot', 'bat', 'but', 'bit']

8. Use a regular expression to find and extract all words that contain either "ea" or "eo" in them.
text = "During many of the peaks and troughs of history, the people living it didn't fully realize what was unfolding. But we all know we're navigating breathtaking history: Nearly every day could be — maybe will be — a book."

pattern = r'\b\w*(?:ea|eo)\w*\b'
print(re.findall(pattern, text))
['peaks', 'people', 'realize', 'breathtaking', 'Nearly']

9. Use a regular expression to find and extract all the capitalized words in the text below individually.
text = "Teddy Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln walk into a bar."

pattern = r'\b[A-Z][a-zA-Z]*\b'
print(re.findall(pattern, text))
['Teddy', 'Roosevelt', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln']

10. Use a regular expression to find and extract all the sets of consecutive capitalized words in the text above.

pattern = r'\b[A-Z][a-zA-Z]*\b'
print(re.findall(pattern, text))
['Teddy', 'Roosevelt', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln']

11. Use a regular expression to find and extract all the quotes from the text below.
Hint: This one is a little more complex than the single quote example in the lesson because there are multiple quotes in the text.
text = 'Roosevelt says to Lincoln, "I will bet you $50 I can get the bartender to give me a free drink." Lincoln says, "I am in!"'

pattern = r'"([^"]*)"'
print(re.findall(pattern, text))
['I will bet you $50 I can get the bartender to give me a free drink.', 'I am in!']

12. Use a regular expression to find and extract all the numbers from the text below.
text = "There were 30 students in the class. Of the 30 students, 14 were male and 16 were female. Only 10 students got A's on the exam."

pattern = r'\d+'
print(re.findall(pattern, text))
['30', '30', '14', '16', '10']

13. Use a regular expression to find and extract all the social security numbers from the text below.
text = """
Henry's social security number is 876-93-2289 and his phone number is (847)789-0984.
Darlene's social security number is 098-32-5295 and her phone number is (987)222-0901.
"""

pattern = r"\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}"
print(re.findall(pattern, text))
['876-93-2289', '098-32-5295']

14. Use a regular expression to find and extract all the phone numbers from the text below.

pattern = r'\(\d{3}\)\d{3}-\d{4}'
print(re.findall(pattern, text))
['(847)789-0984', '(987)222-0901']

15. Use a regular expression to find and extract all the formatted numbers (both social security and phone) from the text below.

pattern = r'\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b|\(\d{3}\)\d{3}-\d{4}'
print(re.findall(pattern, text))
['876-93-2289', '(847)789-0984', '098-32-5295', '(987)222-0901']
